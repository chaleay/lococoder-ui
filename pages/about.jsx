          Nice to see you here. If you're wondering who I am, well, I'm a
          Software Engineer. My primary interests in that area of my life are
          Linux Development, Web Dev, and Game Dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of that, I have a few other hobbies that keep me busy, mainly
          powerlifting and bodybuilding (really anything that involves lifting
          heavy stuff), guitar, and reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here on the blog you can expect to find my day-to-day musings on all
          the various applications and games that I'm working on, my Linux
          experiences, my thoughts on various technologies and framework, as
          well non-technical stuff that piques my interest, ranging from fitness
          to philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, I try to keep my writing style down to earth and simple, and
          and I welcome conversation with any of you lovely people who happen to
          be reading this or want to learn more about me and talk about my
          interests.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading. Enjoy your stay.</p>
